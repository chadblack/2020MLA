1. **Weekly Reports:**  (30%)

Each week, students will write a 1 page paper that synthesizes the readings,
and connects them to weekly themes in class. Weekly Reports are due by
midnight on Thursday, uploaded onto Canvas. The report will respond to all three of the following prompts:

  1. Identify at least one concept, event, claim, or proper noun mentioned in the
     readings that is unfamiliar to you. Use [Reference Tools on the
     Internet](https://libguides.utk.edu/latinamericanhistory) or in
     the library to look up information about it and report your findings, along
     with the source(s) of any information you find. Anything that could be answered
     with a fact-check, quick definition, or basic research might be included under
     this prompt. Be sure to indicate when you are quoting directly from another
     source by using quotation marks. 

  2. Identify one of the Questions or Themes raised in earlier weeks that one of the
     assigned readings helps to answer. Then explain why you think
     this source sheds light on this specific question.

  3. Connect at least one of the readings to the lectures from the week they
     were assigned. How do the readings complement or contradict or expand on
     topics discussed in class?


The entire report will be no more than about one typed, single-spaced page.

For the second of two reaction papers, students will write a 2-3 page
analysis of *The Little School*.
